    <h2>Put those ripe bananas to use in the best banana bread recipe ever. Moist and delicious, it's easy to make—one bowl, no need for a mixer!</h2>
    <p>This is a lovely, moist loaf. It freezes extremely well. Any bananas left in the fruit bowl are ideal for this cake – the riper they are, the better.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>100g Butter</li>
        <li>175g Caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>2 Ripe bananas</li>
        <li>225g Self-rasing flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp Baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Mixed spice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You will need a 900g loaf tin, 17cm x 9cm x 9cm base measurement.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Lightly grease the loaf tin and line it with non-stick baking parchment.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pre-heat the oven to 180°C/Gas Mark 4.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Measure all the ingredients into a mixing bowl and beat for about two minutes, until well blended; an electric mixer is best for this but of course you can also beat by hand with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and level the surface.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake for about one hour, until well risen and golden brown. A fine skewer inserted in the centre of the cake should come out clean.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Leave the cake to cool in the tin for a few minutes, then loosen with a small palette knife and turn the cake out. Remove the lining paper and leave on a wire rack to cool completely. Slice thickly to serve.</li>
        <p><em>Best servered warm with butter.</em></p>
    </ol>
